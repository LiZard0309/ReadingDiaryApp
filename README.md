# ReadingDiaryApp

Implemented Blocks:


Base: Navigation between Fragments and passing on data, ViewModels to read data, Repository to store app data

Block 1: LiveData/MutableLiveData for BookSearch with Observer 

Block 3: API Access and Serialization with ktor, access to Google Books API for book search

Block 4: Concurrency with Coroutines: the book search/api call is made on another thread

Some blocks are only implemented in part. I implemented the parts that made sense in the context of my app.
